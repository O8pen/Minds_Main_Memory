Getting back on track.
This is the most fundamental thing about productivity. 

I have also used it on University exam prepration.

Wake up, open a text editor and start atomizing your day.

HAVING A TEXT EDITOR OPEN IN THE MORNING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

# patotes, cook it
# take a piss
# take a shower
# clean the house
# 

# donanim staji project
# thingspeak test
# open every single thingspeak esp32 tutorial
# try to make 2 esp's communicate
# 

# Check ders kayit for approval
# Check transcript for course fixation.
# 

# Apply for trendyol talen program
# There is a link in sakai
# 

# Work on Atomization.
# Try to figure out how to implement time limit
# Check vscode modile version
# Setup your main memory with github and remote repository
# Constantly delete/archive the completed tasks, when there is 70 lines of text it is really hard to track things
# 

# Code a python script that auto commits your main memory on ctrl+sakai
# ctrl+s starts the script
# Clicks on the commit message and writes "a"
# Hits ctrl+enter
# main memory is automaticly on github
# Restudy the operating systems processes and time schduling
# 

# This message is written from my phone
# This is the response from the computer
# 

# Alwyas have a main memory with you
# Going out and not having a main memory is dangerous
#

# You mind is a single threaded cpu
# It gets interupted by many tasks
(You randomly remember you need to check ders kayit, you need to look for internships)
# But they are not in your memory all the time
# Once an interuption occurs, you forget the previous task that came to your mind
# Only way to track all the tasks is writting them down
# This is your main memory
# Your mind only has cache with low storage and it gets deleted every time you remember a new task.
# If you don't have a main memory you can't track the process and you would be lost in time and space.
