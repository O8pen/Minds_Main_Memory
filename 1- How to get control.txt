Getting back on track.
This is the most fundamental thing about productivity. 

I have also used it on University exam prepration.

Wake up, open a text editor and start atomizing your day.

HAVING A TEXT EDITOR OPEN IN THE MORNING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

# Work on Atomization.
# Try to figure out how to implement time limit
# Check vscode mobile version
# Constantly delete/archive the completed tasks, when there is 70 lines of text it is really hard to track things
# 

# Always have a main memory with you
# Going out and not having a main memory is dangerous
#

# You mind is a single threaded cpu
# It gets interupted by many tasks
(You randomly remember you need to check ders kayit, you need to look for internships)
# But they are not in your memory all the time
# Once an interuption occurs, you forget the previous task that came to your mind
# Only way to track all the tasks is writting them down
# This is your main memory
# Your mind only has cache with low storage and it gets deleted every time you remember a new task.
# If you don't have a main memory you can't track the process and you would be lost in time and space.
# 

# Restudy the operating systems processes and time schduling
