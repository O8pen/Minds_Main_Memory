# Going out and not having a main memory is dangerous

# You mind is a single threaded cpu
# It gets interupted by many tasks
(You randomly remember you need to check ders kayit, you need to look for internships)
# But they are not in your memory all the time
# Once an interuption occurs, you forget the previous task that came to your mind
# Only way to track all the tasks is writting them down
# This is your main memory
# Your mind only has cache with low storage and it gets deleted every time you remember a new task.
# If you don't have a main memory you can't track the process and you would be lost in time and space.
