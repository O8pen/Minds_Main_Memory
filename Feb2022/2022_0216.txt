# HAVING A TEXT EDITOR OPEN IN THE MORNING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

# Constantly delete/archive the completed tasks, when there is 70 lines of text it is really hard to track things

# patotes, cook it
# take a piss
# take a shower
# brush teeth
# clean the house
# get all the tasks from previous day
